"Oczko" â€“ a simple card game where you draw cards until the value of your score (based on cards) is as close to (but not greater than) 21.
          The player draw cards from the deck until decides that he/she not want any more cards or gets a score of 21 or greater.
          A sum greater than or equal to 22 means you lose. The exception to this rule is the "Persian-eyelet" (two aces). Persian eyelet always means win.
